# Magnetic field analysis tools for SOFIA/HAWC+ M51

## Summary
This repository contains the analysis tools used in the SOFIA Legacy Program publication "Extragalactic Magnetism with SOFIA (Legacy Program) I: The magnetic field in the multi-phase interstellar medium of M51", which is available on ArXiv on the following webpage: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09315. The tools contained in sofia_toolbox.py contain most of the software developed for the analysis of the far-infrared polarization observations of the M51 galaxy, plus the ancillary radio polarization observations from Fletcher et al. 2011 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2396F/abstract).
