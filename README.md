# Magnetic field analysis tools for SOFIA/HAWC+ M51

## Summary
This repository contains the analysis tools used in the SOFIA Legacy Program publication "Extragalactic Magnetism with SOFIA (Legacy Program) I: The magnetic field in the multi-phase interstellar medium of M51", which is available on ArXiv on the following webpage: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09315. The tools contained in sofia_toolbox.py contain most of the software developed for the analysis of the far-infrared polarization observations of the M51 galaxy, plus the ancillary radio polarization observations from Fletcher et al. 2011 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2396F/abstract). 


## Functions

### plot_profile(profile, color, linestyle, linewidth, marker, label):
This function plots the magnetic pitch angle profile in an existing matplotlib figure using the profile objects generated with magnetic_pitch_angle function. 

### magnetic_pitch_angle_profile_plot(output_magnetic_pitch_angle_profile):
This is an auxiliary function to generate plots with the full output from magnetic_pitch_angle function. 

### measure_median_pitch_angle(pitch_angle_array):
This function uses the datacubes generated by magnetic_pitch_angle function to estimate the median pitch angle. Those datacubes contain the Montecarlo simulations used to estimate the errorbars for each pixel. 

Input: pitch_angle_array: A datacube generated by magnetic_pitch_angle containing the MonteCarlo simulations of the pitch angle arrays. 
Output: (Dict) - median_pitch_angle: Median pitch angle value of the array. 
               - e95_down: 2.5% percentile of the median pitch angle probability distribution
               - e95_up: 97.5% percentile of the median pitch angle probability distribution.  

### apply_mask(mode, mask_fits, header, I, dI, Q, dQ, U, dU):

This function applies the morphological arm / interarm mask to the I, dI, Q, dQ, U, and dU Stokes arrays. Defined to be used before inputing the Stokes arrays to magnetic_pitch_angle. 

### generate_pitch_model(pitch_profile, shape, header, xcen, ycen, PA, incl, output):

Given a certain pitch angle profile from the magnetic_pitch_angle function (input: pitch_profile) it will return a pitch angle array with dimensions defined by the input parameter "shape (x,y)" where each pixel has the expected value from its azimuthal pitch angle profile. 
xcen and ycen are the central coordinates of the galaxy model in pixels 
PA is the position angle, measured counter-clockwise from the North direction (degrees)
incl is the inclination of the galactic disk 
output is a string, which will be used as the name of the fits file to store the new pitch angle array. 

### save_fits(array, name, header=None):
A function to save arrays in new fits files. 
Array: The input array to save
name: Name of the new fits file
header: Header of the new fits file


### plot_pitch_model(I, pol_obs, pitch_model, SNR_int, SNR_pol, SNRi_cut = 10.0, SNRp_cut = 3.0, step=4, scalevec = 2.5, header=None, save_fig="plot_pitch_model.pdf", vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha_model=1 pol_fraction=None, title=" ", colorscale="viridis", color_model="red", color_obs="black", recenter=None, figsize=6.5, colorbar_label=r'Intensity (Jy arcsec$^{-2}$)')
                     
This is a function to generate 2D images with the overplotted polarization vectors. 
I : The intensity array for the background
pol_obs: The array with the position angles to be plotted. 
Pitch_model: The array with a secondary set of position angles to the plotted. 
SNR_int: Signal-to-noise ratio array for the intensity
SNR_pol: Signal-to-noise ratio array for the polarization
SNRi_cut: Limit for the intensity Signal to noise ratio
SNRp_cut: Limit for the polarization Signal to noise ratio 
Step: Plotting density factor. If 1, all vectors are plotted. Derive a vector only from every ‘step’ pixels. You will normally want this to be >1 to get sensible vector spacing. See https://aplpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/aplpy.FITSFigure.html show_vectors function. 
header: Header of the fits files containing a valid WCS
save_fig: Name of the output figure file.
vmin: Minimum limit for the background intensity image color scale
vmax: Maximum limit for the background intensity image color scale
alpha_model: Transparency control for the secondary pitch angle model vectors
pol_fraction (testing): Array containing polarization % measurements, to be used as scaling factor for the lengths of the vectors.
title: (string) Title of the plot.
colorscale: Matplotlib colormap name. See https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html
color_model: Color for the model vectors (secondary). 
color_obs: Color for the observational vectors (primary).
recenter: Input parameters for the recenter function -  gc.recenter(x=recenter[0], y=recenter[1], width=recenter[2], height=recenter[3]). See https://aplpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/aplpy.FITSFigure.html#aplpy.FITSFigure.recenter
